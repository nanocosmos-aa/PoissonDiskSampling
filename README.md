# PoissonDiskSampling

This is a Swift implementation of the algorithm described in the article ["Poisson Disk Sampling"](http://devmag.org.za/2009/05/03/poisson-disk-sampling/) which, in turn, is based on the paper ["Fast Poisson Disk Sampling in Arbitrary Dimensions"](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~rbridson/docs/bridson-siggraph07-poissondisk.pdf).
